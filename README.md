# DIABETES HEALTH 3-CLASSIFICATOR (3-DHC) A NEURAL NETWORK FOR DIABETES RISK PREDICTION
## Objective
Develop a neural network to classify individuals as diabetic, pre-diabetic or non-diabetic based on health indicators.
## Dataset
Source: Source: Nhanes 2015-2016
Size: 6328 records
Features: 14 features. Some of these features:
HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin), Fasting Glucose
(mg/dL), Fasting Glucose (mmol/L), Body Mass
Index (BMI), Waist Circumference, Age, Lipid
Profile (Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL
Cholesterol, Triglycerides)
## Model Goals
Build an accurate and generalizable predictive model
Analyze feature importance
Visualize training behavior and performance metrics
## Implementation
